										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many marketers would have you believe a post-click landing page is simply any page a visitor lands on after clicking through an advertisement or promotional link. That’s incorrect.</p>
<p>While countless campaigns <i>use</i> a variety of website resources (like homepages, “About” pages, or “Contact Us” pages) as post-click landing pages, <i>that does not make them post-click landing pages.</i></p>
<p>Think of it this way: You could use a baseball glove to retrieve a hot dish from the oven, but that doesn’t make your baseball glove an oven mitt.</p>
<p>Similarly, directing visitors to your homepage or “Contact Us” page doesn’t make those pages post-click landing pages. A post-click landing page is a standalone web page, disconnected from a website’s navigation, created for the sole purpose of convincing a visitor to act (to sign up, buy, download, etc.). This is generally powered by a robust landing page optimization platform:</p>
<div class="video-responsive-wrapper">
<div class="video-responsive video-youtube">
<div class="loader">There are two major reasons every promotion needs its own post-click landing page. Both highlight why it’s a bad idea to direct visitors to your homepage, or a generic page on your website like “About” or “Contact us.” They also highlight how post-click landing pages can generate more conversions for any business. Here are those reasons:</div>
<div>
<p>When visitors arrive here, their expectations are met. There’s no question about whether this post-click landing page is where they’re supposed to be, or whether they’ll be able to claim the offer that was presented in the ad.</p>
<p>On the other hand, without the mention of a 40% discount on the first post-click landing page, visitors may question whether they’re able to claim the offer advertised in the link. Prevent similar confusion on your post-click landing page by making sure:</p>
<p>This is the singular act you want visitors to take. If you’ve created a report post-click landing page, your conversion goal is downloads. If you’ve built a free trial post-click landing page, your conversion goal is signups.</p>
<p>Each post-click landing page should only have <i>one goal.</i> If your post-click landing page is built for the purpose of getting prospects to sign up for a free trial of your service, it shouldn’t also attempt to convince them to download a report. Two CTAs of “Download” and “Sign up” will steal conversions from each other. Instead, it’s better to build a separate page for each.</p>
<p>This practice is based on research that shows what happens when people are presented with too many choices.</p>
<h3><strong>Outbound links</strong></h3>
<p>These are any links that drive users off your post-click landing page. There should be no outbound links in your logo, in the body of your page, or any links in a navigation menu (because your navigation menu should be non-existent… more on that later).</p>
<p>The <i>only</i> link that should drive visitors off the page is the one in your call-to-action button. When they click it, your visitors should be directed to the next step in the conversion process — whether that’s another post-click landing page or a <a href="https://instapage.com/blog/ab-testing-thank-you-pages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“thank you” page</a>. Any other outbound link detracts from your conversions.</p>

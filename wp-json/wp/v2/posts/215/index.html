That\u2019s incorrect.<\/p>\n<p>While countless campaigns\u00a0<i>use<\/i>\u00a0a variety of website resources (like homepages, \u201cAbout\u201d pages, or \u201cContact Us\u201d pages) as post-click landing pages,\u00a0<i>that does not make them post-click landing pages.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way: You could use a baseball glove to retrieve a hot dish from the oven, but that doesn\u2019t make your baseball glove an oven mitt.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, directing visitors to your homepage or \u201cContact Us\u201d page doesn\u2019t make those pages post-click landing pages. A post-click landing page is a standalone web page, disconnected from a website\u2019s navigation, created for the sole purpose of convincing a visitor to act (to sign up, buy, download, etc.). This is generally powered by a robust landing page\u00a0optimization platform:<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-responsive-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"video-responsive video-youtube\">\n<div class=\"loader\">There are two major reasons every promotion needs its own post-click landing page. Both highlight why it\u2019s a bad idea to direct visitors to your homepage, or a generic page on your website like \u201cAbout\u201d or \u201cContact us.\u201d They also highlight how post-click landing pages can generate more conversions for any business. Here are those reasons:<\/div>\n<div>\n<p>When visitors arrive here, their expectations are met. There\u2019s no question about whether this post-click landing page is where they\u2019re supposed to be, or whether they\u2019ll be able to claim the offer that was presented in the ad.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, without the mention of a 40% discount on the first post-click landing page, visitors may question whether they\u2019re able to claim the offer advertised in the link. Prevent similar confusion on your post-click landing page by making sure:<\/p>\n<p>This is the singular act you want visitors to take. If you\u2019ve created a report post-click landing page, your conversion goal is downloads. If you\u2019ve built a free trial post-click landing page, your conversion goal is signups.<\/p>\n<p>Each post-click landing page should only have\u00a0<i>one goal.<\/i>\u00a0If your post-click landing page is built for the purpose of getting prospects to sign up for a free trial of your service, it shouldn\u2019t also attempt to convince them to download a report. Two CTAs of \u201cDownload\u201d and \u201cSign up\u201d will steal conversions from each other. Instead, it\u2019s better to build a separate page for each.<\/p>\n<p>This practice is based on research that shows what happens when people are presented with too many choices.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Outbound links<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>These are any links that drive users off your post-click landing page. There should be no outbound links in your logo, in the body of your page, or any links in a navigation menu (because your navigation menu should be non-existent\u2026 more on that later).<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0<i>only<\/i>\u00a0link that should drive visitors off the page is the one in your call-to-action button. When they click it, your visitors should be directed to the next step in the conversion process \u2014 whether that\u2019s another post-click landing page or a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/instapage.com\/blog\/ab-testing-thank-you-pages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u201cthank you\u201d page<\/a>.
